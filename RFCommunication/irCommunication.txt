IR light is like visible light but it is invisible to our eyes, because of which they are suitable in application of wireless communication.
The band for IR (Infrared) in electromagnetic spectrum is 300GHz to 430 THz and wavelength range of around 700nm to 1mm.
Along with the IR LED some other sources like sun, light bulbs, human and animal bodies etc. also emit infrared energy.
IR communication is used for short and medium distance applications.

Principle of Working
IR LEDs transmit digital (logical 1 and 0) data in the form of infrared light.
Logical 1 is emitted by keeping IR LED ON and logical 0 by keeping it OFF.
This ON and OFF sequence of data is collected by IR photodiode at receiver end.

IR Communication types
1) Point to point communication : In point to point communication, line of sight is required between transmitter and receiver devices.

2) Diffuse communication : In diffuse communication, no need to keep transmitter and receiver in
 straight line of sight. It can be done by reflecting or bouncing the transmitted signal from surfaces like wall, ceilings etc.

 IR Communication using Modulation
In modulation type of IR communication, IR light is modulated with carrier
frequencies to get better distance available.

Also, it provides better immunity to surrounding IR interferences. Generally,
 TSOP series receivers are used to receive modulated IR light.
