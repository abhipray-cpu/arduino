IR Communication is a very easy to use, inexpensive and 
common way of communication. IR radiation is basically a 
light that cannot be seen by a human eye. As it is undetectable 
to human eye, it is perfect for wireless communication. IR radiations 
are everywhere, these emits from sun, light bulbs and many other things.

IR light (Transmitter) is almost similar to visible light except its wavelength 
is longer. When you hit a TV remote button, IR Led transmit information to the TV.
 IR Led turns on and off 38000 times a second to transmit information to IR receiver in TV.

 IR sender module:
 The IR sender is used to receive the infrared rays 
 that are emitted by IR emitter. The IR receiver module 
 consists of a IR receiver. The IR receiver is of many types, 
 some are shown below
It has module comes with a remote.
 These are inexpensive and can be used in 
 many projects from simple to complicated.
  The basically consists of a IR emitter that sends a 
  signal to IR receiver connected with the Arduino.

  Ir receive:
  he connections are very easier. Connect the 5V and ground of the Arduino to the 5v and ground of 
  the IR receiver and the pin 11 of the Arduino to the signal pin of IR receiver.

Before uploading the code, download the library from here  and place it in the Arduino/libraries directory


include this library IRremote.h
for ir communication

Code for receiver:example

  2)code for Transmitter:
  The IR emitter is also known as the IR transmitter
  . The IR emitter module is very inexpensive and it is very easy to use.
   It has many applications. It can be used in the projects like controlling 
   a TV, controlling a motor and many things can be controlled using it.
    The IR emitter module consists of a Light emitting diode that is similar
     to the common light emitting diode but different material is used. 
     This diode sends the information in the form of infrared rays that
      is then received by the receiver.

      // This code is for the IR emitter Module
// install the library before uploading the code
#include <Arduino.h>
#include<IRremote.h>
#define switch 4
IRsend irsend ;

void setup( )
{pinMode(switch,INPUT);
Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop()
{
int val=digitalRead(switch);
if(val == HIGH){
  Serial.println("re daba diya button tau");
  irsend.sendNEC(0x20dfc03f, 32); // This command is for volume up
}
