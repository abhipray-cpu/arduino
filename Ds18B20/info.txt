DS18B20 Temperature Module: The temperature module is 
used to sense the temperature at a much accurate level 
than the other temperature sensors. The temperature module
 consists of a one wire temperature sensor (DS18B20) 
 also known as (Dallas). This module can be used with
  any if the microcontroller like raspberry pi and 
  Arduino but we are using the Arduino. The temperature
   module has wide range accuracy. It is accurate up
    to ± 0.5 ᴼC over the range of -10 ᴼC to +85 ᴼC.

    You can locate these sensors at a much larger distance from your Arduino,
     almost 100 meter away from your Arduino. 
     If you will use this sensor alone, then you will have
      to use a 5 K ohm pull up resistor but in our module you 
      do not need to use it. It has built in pull up resistor in
       it.It has a resolution of 12 bit. It gets powers up in a
        low power idle state. To measure the temperature and to 
        do the A to D conversion, it should get a convert T [ 44h ] c
        ommand from the master. After the conversion, the data will 
        be stored in the 2-byte temperature register and the sensor
         will return to idle state.
