Commercial fire safety devices are advanced with a lot of complex circuitry.
 If you want to implement a DIY Fire or Flame detection application, then this project might be helpful.

Warning: This project is just to give you an idea on how to implement a
 simple Flame Sensor using Arduino Platform and we do not guarantee its commercial applications.
