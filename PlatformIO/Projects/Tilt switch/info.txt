Arduino KY-017 mercury tilt switch module, it uses a small mercury ball that completes the circuit when you tilt the module. 
This module consists of a mercury switch, a 680Î© resistor and a LED that will light up when tilt is detected. The mercury ball
 will open/close the circuit when the module is rotated.
