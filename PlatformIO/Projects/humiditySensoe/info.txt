Pinout for this sensor:(Left to Right)
1)signal
2)vcc

note never power smd rgb with other sensor from uno as it will overload the board beacuase the smdd consume much power therfore
power it(smd rgb) seprately use rgb led

the led can't be controlled via same board since it cosumes much power a lower power led can be used
