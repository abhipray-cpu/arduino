So a buzzer is used to make a buzz sound and there are two kind of buzzers one is active and other is passive.
Let's see the difference between the two:
An active buzzer generates the sound itself.
 You basically just turn it on or off. A passive 
 buzzer needs a signal source that provides the sound
  signal. To find out which is which you can measure
   the resistance between both leads.


1)passive Buuzer:we have to provide it with a signal in order to produce the sound

so a major difference between the two is
1)Active :gaandphaad awaaz nikalti hai but ek hi awaaz nikal skta hai
2)Passive:less loud as compared to the active but sound can be varrried by chaning the signal
