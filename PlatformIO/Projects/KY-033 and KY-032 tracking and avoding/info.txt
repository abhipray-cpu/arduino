The tracking module is used to track a line
The sensor detects if a light reflecting or absorbing area is in front of it. 
It shows which of the 2 areas it is via digital output, as you can see in the picture below.
The Sensitivity (minimum range) of the sensor can be adjusted by the controller.

This behavior can be used to automatically follow a line with a robot.

so this sensor can be used as object detector has well and can be used to differentiate between a ligght absorbing
as well as ligth reflecting surface

for light reflecting surface red light will be lighted
and for reflecting no such change

it sends a beam of light and other sensor measures for the reflected light
if it gets some means the surface is of reflecting type and if not the surface is of absorbing type
