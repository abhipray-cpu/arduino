Arduino KY-032 obstacle avoidance sensor is a distance-adjustable
, infrared proximity sensor designed for wheeled robots. Also known as AD-032.

The sensor detection distance ranges from 2cm to 40cm, it can be adjusted by turning
 the potentiometer knob. The operating voltage is 3.3V-5V so it is suitable for a variety 
 of microcontrollers like Arduino, ESP32, Teensy, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi, and others.

It has strong adaptability to ambient light and it is fairly accurate to sense changes in the surrounding environment.
