A photoresistor or photocell is a light-controlled variable resistor.
 The resistance of a photoresistor decreases with increasing incident light intensity. 
 A photoresistor can be applied in light-sensitive detector circuits, and light- and dark-activated switching circuits.
  It's also called light-dependent resistor (LDR).

In this tutorial you will learn how to use a photoresistor with and without arduino uno.

Haan tau so this sensor is good for light sensitive projects
