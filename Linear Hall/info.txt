Same as reed switch pluus it can measure polarity as well as intesity of magneetic field
The KY-024 Linear magnetic Hall sensor reacts in the presence of a magnetic field. It has a
 potentiometer to adjust the sensitivity of the sensor and it
 provides both analog and digital outputs.

The digital output acts as a switch that will turn on/off when a magnet is near, 
similar to the KY-003. On the other hand, the analog output can measure the polarity
 and relative strength of the magnetic field.
