KNOCK SENSOR
SO a knock sensor is a piezo device that is used to detect a deformation causes by a mechanical wave for example a sound wave
vibration or mechanical strain 

The sketch reads the piezo output using the analogRead() command, encoding the voltage range from 0
 to 5 volts to a numerical range from 0 to 1023 in a process referred to as analog-to-digital conversion, or ADC.

If the sensors output is stronger than a certain threshold, your board will send the string "Knock!" to the computer over the serial port.

Sp why a resistor is required to measure a knock?
Since the piezo current is very small and we require an min threshold to measure
and since V=I * R


for 1M resistance the best threshold values are 156 and 157

therefore a large resistance ~ 1Millionn ohms is required to make the voltage measurable.
Therfore a one million reistor is connected in series with the power supply.
Supply this resistance between the sensor pin and the analog pin you are using to measure the voltage.

Keep in mind your threshold value is directlry proportional to the resistance you are applying

Here is a simple code to detect a knock:

#include<Arduino.h>
const int knockSensor = A0; // the piezo is connected to analog pin 0
const int threshold = 156;  // threshold value to decide when the detected sound is a knock or not


// these variables will change:
int sensorReading = 0;      // variable to store the value read from the sensor pin
int ledState = LOW;         // variable used to store the last LED status, to toggle the light

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);       // use the serial port
}

void loop() {
  // read the sensor and store it in the variable sensorReading:
  sensorReading = analogRead(knockSensor);

  // if the sensor reading is greater than the threshold:
  if (sensorReading >= threshold) {
    // send the string "Knock!" back to the computer, followed by newline
    Serial.println("Knock!");
  }
  delay(100);  // delay to avoid overloading the serial port buffer
}
